I want you to look at the current issues list and use @general @explore and @review agents to fully work issues do prs make sure ci passes and get these issues completed.  continuously check that ci is clean and passing, raise more issues as you find them, keep checking back for new issues, use worktrees heavily to delegate work in parallel, use a directory you already have access to. dont stop until all issues are complete and prs are merged in.
