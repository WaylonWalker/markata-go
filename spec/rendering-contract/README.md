# Rendering contract

`contract-v1.json` is the single authoring source for presentation IDs,
variants, roles, defaults, bounds, and migration aliases.

Use the contract version and its migration table before changing theme data.
Add shared palette families and presentation dials here first. Do not add a
second registry in a site or consumer.

Regenerate all consumer projections from the Markata-Go repository root:

```bash
go run ./scripts/rendering-contract
go run ./scripts/rendering-contract --check
```

The generated Go and browser artifacts must be committed with a source change.

## Motif layer invariant

The page background is the base. The motif is an independent decorative pass.
`under` renders the motif below the surface texture; `over` renders it above
the texture; `sandwich` renders one motif pass below and one above the texture.
The surface texture mix controls only the texture pass. A zero texture mix does
not remove a configured sandwich motif. A zero motif mix makes the motif
background-equivalent, while one uses the full selected motif color. Geometry
(`size`, `gap`, `row_offset`, `wobble`, and `scatter`) remains active at every
mix value. `size` is the width of one visible motif mark, not a multi-mark
source tile. `gap` controls the space around that mark. A configured motif
remains fully opaque at every non-off mix value; `color_mix` only interpolates
between the background color and the selected motif color.
