# Font packs

Markata uses `fontpack` to select typography. The default is `system`, a
zero-download pack that emits semantic `--font-*` variables but no font
binary or `@font-face` rule. Built-in catalog data, manifests, licenses, and
font files are embedded in the Markata executable; they never require a
source checkout or a catalog in the site's working directory.

Bundled packs use prebuilt WOFF2 files and stable catalog tiers. Builds copy
only referenced tiers into `output/assets/fonts` and write one shared
`output/css/fonts.css`; page content never creates a new subset. The optional
FontTools workflow is intentionally separate from ordinary builds.

Custom catalogs may be selected with `fontpacks_file`. Relative paths in a
custom catalog resolve relative to the catalog file. Markata records generated
font filenames in `output/assets/fonts/.markata-fonts.json` and removes only
stale files listed by that manifest on later builds.

`fonts verify` checks manifest and lockfile provenance, license metadata, full
64-character SHA-256 hashes, and WOFF2 assets. Short hashes are display-only.
