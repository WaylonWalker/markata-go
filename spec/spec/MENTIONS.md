# Mentions Plugin Specification

The mentions plugin transforms `@handle` syntax in markdown content into HTML links, resolving handles from blogroll feeds, internal posts, and configured authors.

## Overview

The mentions plugin processes `@handle` patterns in post content and replaces them with HTML anchor links. Handles are resolved from three sources:

1. **Blogroll feeds** - External RSS/Atom feed entries with handles
2. **Internal posts** - Posts matching filter expressions (e.g., contact pages, team pages, author pages)
3. **Authors** - Authors defined in the site configuration are automatically registered as mentionable contacts

## Syntax

```markdown
@handle           # Basic mention
@alice-smith      # Hyphenated handle
@alice123         # Handle with numbers
```

Handle pattern: `@[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*`

### Trailing Punctuation

When a handle includes trailing punctuation (e.g., `@alice.` at end of a sentence), the plugin first tries an exact match. If the exact match fails, trailing punctuation characters (`.,;:!?`) are stripped and the lookup is retried. This preserves domain-style handles like `@simonwillison.net` (which match exactly) while correctly resolving `@alice.` → `@alice` + `.`.

```markdown
Talk to @alice.      <!-- Resolves to @alice, period is preserved as text -->
Visit @simonwillison.net  <!-- Resolves to @simonwillison.net (exact match) -->
Hey @bob, welcome!   <!-- Resolves to @bob, comma is preserved as text -->
```

## Configuration

```toml
[markata-go.mentions]
enabled = true                    # Enable/disable the plugin (default: true)
css_class = "mention"             # CSS class for links (default: "mention")

# Source handles from internal posts (optional - a default source is provided, see below)
[[markata-go.mentions.from_posts]]
filter = "template == 'contact'"  # Filter expression to select posts
handle_field = "handle"           # Frontmatter field for handle (optional, uses slug if not set)
aliases_field = "aliases"         # Frontmatter field for aliases (optional)
avatar_field = "avatar"           # Frontmatter field for avatar URL (optional, auto-detects if not set)
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Enable/disable mentions processing |
| `css_class` | string | `"mention"` | CSS class applied to mention links |
| `from_posts` | array | see below | List of internal post sources |

### from_posts Default

When no `from_posts` sources are configured (or when a `[markata-go.mentions]` section exists without any `[[markata-go.mentions.from_posts]]` entries), a default source is used:

```toml
[[markata-go.mentions.from_posts]]
filter = "template == 'contact'"
handle_field = "handle"
```

This means any post with `template: contact` in its frontmatter is automatically available as a mentionable contact. To disable this default, set `from_posts` to an explicit source with a different filter.

### from_posts Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `filter` | string | Yes | Filter expression to select posts |
| `handle_field` | string | No | Frontmatter field containing the handle (defaults to post slug) |
| `aliases_field` | string | No | Frontmatter field containing handle aliases |
| `avatar_field` | string | No | Frontmatter field containing avatar URL. If not set, checks `avatar`, `image`, `icon` in order |

## Handle Resolution

### Resolution Order

Handles are registered in this order (first registration wins):

1. **Blogroll feeds** - If blogroll is enabled, handles from feeds are registered first
2. **Authors** - Authors from site configuration are registered (using author ID as handle)
3. **from_posts sources** - Processed in the order they appear in configuration

If a handle or alias is already registered, subsequent registrations are ignored with a warning.

### From Blogroll

When blogroll is enabled, handles are extracted from feed configurations:

```toml
[[markata-go.blogroll.feeds]]
url = "https://example.com/feed.xml"
title = "Example Blog"
handle = "example"                  # Primary handle
site_url = "https://example.com"    # Link target
aliases = ["ex", "exblog"]          # Additional handles
```

The `site_url` becomes the link target for `@example`, `@ex`, and `@exblog`.

### From Authors

Authors defined in the site configuration (`[markata-go.authors.authors.*]`) are automatically registered as mentionable contacts. Each author is registered using their config key (ID) as the handle. The author's URL (if set) is used as the link target; if no URL is set, the author is not registered.

```toml
[markata-go.authors.authors.waylon]
name = "Waylon Walker"
url = "https://waylonwalker.com"
avatar = "/images/waylon.jpg"
bio = "Python and Go developer"
```

This automatically registers `@waylon` as a mention handle pointing to `https://waylonwalker.com`, with name, avatar, and bio metadata for hovercards.

**Author posts**: Posts with `template: author` are also automatically included as a default `from_posts` source, similar to `template: contact`. This allows author profiles to be defined as regular posts.

### From Internal Posts

Internal posts are filtered using the filter expression, then handles are extracted:

1. **Handle extraction**: Uses `handle_field` frontmatter value, or falls back to post slug
2. **Alias extraction**: Uses `aliases_field` frontmatter value if specified
3. **Link target**: The post's permalink URL

Example post frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Alice Smith"
slug: alice-smith
template: contact
tags:
  - contact
handle: alice
aliases:
  - alices
  - asmith
avatar: /images/alice.jpg
url: https://alicesmith.dev
description: "Software engineer specializing in Go and web development."
---
```

With config:

```toml
[[markata-go.mentions.from_posts]]
filter = "template == 'contact'"
handle_field = "handle"
aliases_field = "aliases"
```

This registers:
- `@alice` → `/contact/alice-smith/`
- `@alices` → `/contact/alice-smith/`
- `@asmith` → `/contact/alice-smith/`

### Slug Fallback

If `handle_field` is empty or the specified field is not present in frontmatter, the post's slug is used:

```toml
[[markata-go.mentions.from_posts]]
filter = "'project' in tags"
# No handle_field - uses slug
```

A post with `slug: my-project` registers `@my-project`.

## Transform Behavior

### Processing

1. Extract code blocks and store them (to protect from transformation)
2. Find all `@handle` patterns in content
3. For each handle:
   - Look up in handle map
   - If found: replace with anchor link
   - If not found: leave as-is
4. Restore code blocks

### Email Protection

Email addresses are not transformed. The regex matches `@` only when:
- NOT preceded by word characters (letters, digits, underscore)

```markdown
test@example.com     <!-- Not transformed (email) -->
Follow @example      <!-- Transformed -->
Say hello@example    <!-- Not transformed (no space before @) -->
```

### Code Block Protection

Mentions inside fenced code blocks are preserved:

````markdown
Check out @alice's post.

```
// @alice is not transformed here
const handle = "@alice";
```
````

### Generated HTML

For external mentions (blogroll):

```html
<a href="https://example.com" class="mention" data-name="Example Blog" data-bio="A great blog" data-avatar="https://example.com/avatar.jpg" data-handle="@example">@example</a>
```

For internal mentions (from_posts), the link points to the contact page and includes metadata for hovercards:

```html
<a href="/contact/alice-smith/" class="mention" data-name="Alice Smith" data-bio="Software engineer specializing in Go and web development." data-avatar="/images/alice.jpg" data-handle="@alice">@alice</a>
```

Attributes:
- `href` - Link target URL (contact page for internal, site URL for external)
- `class` - Configured CSS class (default: "mention")
- `data-name` - Display name (from metadata or post title)
- `data-bio` - Bio/description (from metadata or post description)
- `data-avatar` - Avatar URL (from metadata or post frontmatter)
- `data-handle` - The original @handle

The display text is always `@handle` for both internal and external mentions.
The `data-name`, `data-bio`, and `data-avatar` attributes provide hovercard data.

## Lifecycle Stage

The mentions plugin runs in the **Transform** stage with default priority (0).

## Data Model

### MentionsConfig

```go
type MentionsConfig struct {
    Enabled   *bool               // Enable/disable (default: true)
    CSSClass  string              // CSS class (default: "mention")
    FromPosts []MentionPostSource // Internal post sources
}
```

### MentionPostSource

```go
type MentionPostSource struct {
    Filter       string // Filter expression (required)
    HandleField  string // Frontmatter field for handle (optional)
    AliasesField string // Frontmatter field for aliases (optional)
    AvatarField  string // Frontmatter field for avatar URL (optional)
}
```

### Internal Handle Map

```go
// handleMap maps handles to URLs
type handleMap map[string]string

// Example:
// "alice" → "/contact/alice/"
// "alices" → "/contact/alice/"
// "daverupert" → "https://daverupert.com"
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Unknown handle | Left as plain text (`@unknown`) |
| Duplicate handle registration | Warning logged, first registration wins |
| Invalid filter expression | Error logged, source skipped |
| Missing handle_field in frontmatter | Falls back to slug |
| Empty aliases_field | No aliases registered for that post |

## CSS Classes

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `.mention` | Default class for all mention links |

Custom class can be configured via `css_class` option.

## Examples

### Team Directory

```toml
[[markata-go.mentions.from_posts]]
filter = "'team' in tags and published == true"
handle_field = "slack_handle"
aliases_field = "nicknames"
```

### Multiple Sources

```toml
# External blogroll
[markata-go.blogroll]
enabled = true

[[markata-go.blogroll.feeds]]
url = "https://external.com/feed.xml"
handle = "external"
site_url = "https://external.com"

# Internal contacts
[[markata-go.mentions.from_posts]]
filter = "template == 'contact'"
handle_field = "handle"
aliases_field = "aliases"

# Internal projects
[[markata-go.mentions.from_posts]]
filter = "'project' in tags"
# Uses slug as handle
```

### Minimal Configuration

```toml
# Just enable with defaults - automatically picks up template: contact posts
# and blogroll handles
[markata-go.mentions]
enabled = true
```

This uses the default `from_posts` source (`template == 'contact'` filter with `handle` field), so any post with `template: contact` frontmatter is automatically mentionable.

## Chat Admonition Integration

When a `chat` or `chat-reply` admonition title starts with `@handle`, the mentions plugin enriches the title with the contact's avatar and a linked name. This creates a conversation-like display where each chat bubble shows who is speaking.

### Syntax

```markdown
!!! chat "@alice"
    Hey, have you seen the new release?

!!! chat-reply "@bob"
    Yes! The new features look great.

!!! chat "@alice"
    Let me show you how the mentions work.
```

### Rendered HTML

When the title starts with `@handle` and the handle resolves in the mention map, the admonition title is replaced with:

```html
<span class="chat-contact">
  <img class="chat-contact-avatar" src="/images/alice.jpg" alt="Alice Smith" />
  <a href="/contact/alice/" class="mention" data-name="Alice Smith" data-bio="..." data-avatar="/images/alice.jpg" data-handle="@alice">@alice</a>
</span>
```

If the handle does not resolve, the title remains as plain text (e.g., `@alice`).

### CSS Classes

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `.chat-contact` | Wrapper for avatar + mention link in chat title |
| `.chat-contact-avatar` | Avatar image in chat title (32x32, rounded) |
