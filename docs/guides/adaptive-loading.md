# Adaptive Loading

Markata-Go sites keep article text available immediately and let the browser
load images and video with native HTML behavior. Visitors can choose how much
optional media work the site should do.

## Choose a loading mode

Open **Loading** in the site header and choose one of these modes:

- **Auto** uses recent browser connection hints and a few real resource timings.
- **Save Data** limits optional media work and speculative requests.
- **Full Quality** allows optional work to begin sooner.

Auto is the default. A saved Save Data or Full Quality choice always takes
precedence over Auto. The preference is stored in the current browser only.

## What Auto does

Auto uses `navigator.connection` when the browser exposes it, but the site
works without that API. It also learns from a small number of recent navigation
and resource timings. One slow image or request does not change the mode. Auto
requires two meaningful transfers below 2 Mbps to constrain optional work and
four consecutive transfers above 4 Mbps with low response latency to recover.
Generic 4g/downlink hints initialize Auto but cannot erase measured evidence.
Browser Save Data intent constrains Auto immediately. Each page observes at
most twelve transfers for thirty seconds; later pages can provide fresh evidence.
Offline constrains Auto immediately, and reconnecting needs fresh evidence.
Suggestions require four poor observations for Full Quality or five good ones
for Save Data.

If Auto becomes confident that your manual choice no longer fits the
connection, a small status prompt offers **Use Auto** or **Keep [mode]**.
Keeping or dismissing the choice quiets the prompt for the current session.

## Media and JavaScript

Images use browser-native loading and retain their dimensions while loading.
Derived video posters reserve a 16:9 frame when the author has not supplied
height or inline styling. Supply your own height/style for a different frame.
Video previews show a poster and do not fetch the video until playback is
requested. Article video keeps native controls and remains usable if JavaScript
does not run. The adaptive script does not replace an image that is already
visible or restart a video when the connection changes.

Markdown videos default to no autoplay and `preload = "none"`. Raw HTML keeps
explicit autoplay intent in `data-authored-autoplay="true"`, while removing the
native autoplay attribute and using preload none. Raw HTML without autoplay
never gains it from the site-wide Markdown setting.
To opt into GIF-like playback for site videos, set:

```toml
[markata-go.md_video]
autoplay = true
loop = true
muted = true
preload = "metadata"
```

The generated intent marker allows Full Quality or already-confident fast Auto at page entry to
start authored autoplay. Save Data and constrained/unknown Auto leave the poster
until interaction. Videos authored without autoplay stay manual in every mode.
Reduced motion also prevents automatic playback. Changing policy does not pause,
restart, or replace a video that has begun loading or playing. With JavaScript
disabled, even authored autoplay requires pressing the native controls; this
keeps the initial document conservative before a visitor's preference is known.

The controller is a small theme asset. Video and embed helpers remain
conditional, so a text-only page does not load a player just in case.


Auto honors authored autoplay when measured confidence is already fast at page
entry. Learning that the network is fast during a page view affects subsequent
pages; it does not suddenly animate an existing poster. An explicit Full Quality
choice may start unrequested authored video on the current page. Active media
remains untouched in either case.


Keep native controls enabled (or supply an accessible play action) for deferred
videos. A video deliberately authored without controls needs its own interaction
path in Save Data and no-JS mode; autoplay intent alone is not a play control.


The existing full-document View Transition navigator preserves loading-mode
attributes and the persistent control. Each completed route initializes only
its newly inserted authored media, expires stale session evidence, and opens a
fresh bounded timing window. It does not rerun the controller or reset the
visitor's manual choice.
