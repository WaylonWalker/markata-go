# Image Optimization

The `image_optimization` plugin generates AVIF and WebP variants for local images and rewrites HTML to use a `<picture>` element with the original image as the fallback.

## Quick Start

Enable the plugin in your hooks:

```toml
[markata-go]
hooks = ["default", "image_optimization"]

[markata-go.image_optimization]
enabled = true
```

## Requirements

- `avifenc` for AVIF output
- `cwebp` for WebP output

If a tool is missing, the build continues and that format is skipped.

## Example Output

Input HTML:

```html
<img src="/images/cat.jpg" alt="Cat">
```

Output HTML:

```html
<picture>
  <source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/cat-480w.avif 480w, /images/cat-960w.avif 960w" sizes="100vw">
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/cat-480w.webp 480w, /images/cat-960w.webp 960w" sizes="100vw">
  <img src="/images/cat.jpg" alt="Cat">
</picture>
```

The generated `.avif` and `.webp` files are written next to the original image in the output folder.

The optimizer reuses the image cache in `.markata/image-cache` and skips re-encoding unchanged inputs across rebuilds.

## Configuration

```toml
[markata-go.image_optimization]
enabled = true
formats = ["avif", "webp"]
quality = 80
avif_quality = 80
webp_quality = 80
widths = [480, 960]
sizes = "100vw"
cache_dir = ".markata/image-cache"
avifenc_path = ""
cwebp_path = ""
```

### Notes

- Only local images are processed (relative paths and site-root paths).
- External URLs, protocol-relative URLs, and data URIs are skipped.
- Images already inside `<picture>` are left unchanged.
