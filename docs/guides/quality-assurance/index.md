## Why Quality Assurance?

Content quality issues can harm your site in several ways:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Invalid frontmatter | Build failures, missing metadata |
| Broken links | Poor user experience, SEO penalties |
| Inconsistent Markdown | Rendering issues, maintenance burden |
| Missing alt text | Accessibility violations, SEO impact |
| YAML syntax errors | Build failures, data loss |

Automated quality checks catch these issues before they reach production.

---

## Quick Setup

Get started with content quality checks in under 5 minutes:

### 1. Install pre-commit

```bash
# macOS
brew install pre-commit

# pip (all platforms)
pip install pre-commit
```

### 2. Create Configuration

Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your site root:

```yaml
repos:
  # YAML/Frontmatter validation
  - repo: https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint
    rev: v1.35.1
    hooks:
      - id: yamllint
        args: [--config-file, .yamllint.yml]
        types: [markdown]

  # Markdown linting
  - repo: https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli
    rev: v0.42.0
    hooks:
      - id: markdownlint
        args: [--config, .markdownlint.json]
```

### 3. Add Linter Configs

Create `.yamllint.yml`:

```yaml
extends: relaxed
rules:
  line-length: disable
  document-start: disable
```

Create `.markdownlint.json`:

```json
{
  "MD013": false,
  "MD033": false,
  "MD041": false
}
```

### 4. Install and Run

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Now every commit will automatically validate your content!
