# Markdown Containers

markata-go supports fenced Markdown containers for grouping content in a `<div>` with classes, an optional ID, and custom attributes.

## Basic container

Use three or more colons followed by a class name or attributes to open a container. Close it with a bare line containing only the same number of colons.

````markdown
::: card {#intro .featured data-kind="note"}
This Markdown is inside the card.
:::
````

The closing line must be **colon-only**. A line such as `::: card`, `::: {.card}`, or a decorated/indented marker should not be used as a closer.

## Nested containers

Use a longer fence for each nested level and close each level with its matching bare fence. This makes the structure predictable and keeps content after an inner close inside its parent container.

````markdown
::: cards
Outer content before the card.

:::: card
Inner card content.
::::

Outer content after the card.
:::
````

The example above renders the `card` inside `cards`, then continues rendering the final paragraph inside the outer `cards` container.

A useful rule is:

| Purpose | Example |
|---|---|
| Open outer container | `::: cards` |
| Open nested container | `:::: card` |
| Close nested container | `::::` |
| Close outer container | `:::` |

Do not rely on a shorter outer closing fence to implicitly close deeper nested containers. Close the innermost container first with the same number of colons it used to open, then close the parent.

## Classes and attributes

The opening line can include multiple classes and an attribute block:

````markdown
:::: panel wide {#example .accent data-state="ready"}
Content
::::
````

This produces a container with the classes `panel`, `wide`, and `accent`, the ID `example`, and the custom `data-state` attribute.

## Web Awesome example

The same nesting rule is useful for components that transform Markdown containers after rendering:

````markdown
::: wa-tabs

:::: wa-tab {label="macOS"}
```bash
brew install markata-go
```
::::

:::: wa-tab {label="Linux"}
```bash
curl -fsSL https://example.com/install.sh | sh
```
::::

:::
````

The outer `wa-tabs` container uses three colons and each nested `wa-tab` uses four, so the structure is unambiguous.
