# Build DAG plugin ownership inventory

This document is the conservative ownership audit for the feature-flagged DAG executor. It follows the resource vocabulary in `pkg/builddag`: `site`, `files`, `post`, `feed`, `cache`, `output`, `template`, `external`, and `plugin`.

The inventory is intentionally stricter than an implementation-level code review. A plugin is **not** parallel-safe merely because its loop body looks independent. Unknown ownership, manager mutation, package/global caches, filesystem walks, external processes, and network access all keep work serialized until an explicit task boundary owns those resources.

## Classification

- **exclusive** — site/global state or unclear ownership; keep serialized.
- **aggregate** — reads or mutates a collection and therefore forms a barrier.
- **per-post candidate** — plausible one-task-per-post boundary after an API refactor.
- **per-feed candidate** — plausible one-task-per-feed boundary after an API refactor.
- **per-output candidate** — plausible one-task-per-owned-output-path boundary after an API refactor.
- **external/network** — external state, subprocesses, or network access requires a separate isolation/rate-limit policy even if item-local work exists.

All current `LegacyTasks` remain `ScopeSite`, `Exclusive=true`, and `ParallelSafe=false`. The classifications below describe possible future decomposition only.

## Configure / discovery / load

| Plugin | Classification | Conservative resources / side effects | Refactor required before fan-out |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build_cache` | exclusive | write `cache:*`, plugin state, lifecycle persistence | Keep barrier; expose namespace-safe cache operations before any overlap. |
| `theme_calendar` | exclusive | read/write `site:config`, plugin state | Configuration mutation must finish before downstream tasks. |
| `glob` | exclusive | write `files:*`, read `site:config`, filesystem walk | Discovery is a barrier that establishes the file set. |
| `background` | exclusive | read/write `site:config` | Configuration mutation must remain ordered. |
| `cdn_assets` | external/network + per-output candidate | network, cache, write `output:static/*`, config/plugin state | Separate fetch/cache planning from deterministic per-asset writes; add rate limits. |
| `icon_vendor` | external/network + per-output candidate | network/cache, vendor asset outputs, plugin index | Split vendor fetch/index from per-pack output ownership. |
| `tailwind` | external/network/exclusive | subprocess/toolchain, templates/includes, CSS output, config | Isolate subprocess inputs/outputs and eliminate shared include mutation. |
| `load` | aggregate/barrier | read `files:*`, write `post:*`, post index, cache | Load establishes the post collection; per-file parse tasks require deterministic merge/index phase. |
| `python_docs` | external + aggregate | source filesystem/import inspection, creates posts | Split source discovery/parse from deterministic post insertion. |
| `tag_aggregator` | aggregate | reads/writes all posts/tags and tag-derived state | Requires item-local normalization plus deterministic aggregate merge. |

## Collect

## First fan-out candidates

The first fan-out PRs should stay **serial** even after the graph contains item-level nodes. Resource claims should be added before any task is marked parallel-safe.

1. **`publish_html` — one task per post/output path.** High payoff and naturally disjoint output ownership. Refactor the plugin to produce an immutable publish plan, then expose a one-post writer. Claims: read `post:<id>` and `template:*`; write `output:<post-path>`.
2. **`publish_feeds` — one task per feed/format.** Feed objects already form natural units and outputs are usually disjoint. Claims: read `feed:<slug>`; write exact `output:<feed-path>`.
3. **`render_markdown` — one task per post.** CPU-heavy and item-local in intent. First make renderer/config state immutable and extract a post-local API. Claims: write `post:<id>` plus read-only plugin/config resources.
4. **`reading_time` — one task per post.** Small, low-risk proving ground for the per-post task API and graph fan-out mechanics. Claims: write `post:<id>`.
5. **`css_minify` / `js_minify` — one task per planned output file.** Straightforward filesystem ownership once directory walking is separated into a deterministic planning barrier. Claims: write exact `output:<path>`.

`auto_title`, `description`, `toc`, `heading_anchors`, `image_zoom`, and several HTML transforms are also strong per-post candidates, but they should follow the first shared per-post adapter rather than each inventing a scheduler integration.

## Required safety rules before concurrency

1. A fan-out task must name every mutable/shared resource it reads or writes.
2. Unknown ownership remains exclusive.
3. A write claim owns reads performed as part of mutating the same resource; a task must not declare duplicate read+write claims for one resource.
4. Collection planning/validation remains a barrier before item-level tasks consume the plan.
5. External/network work needs explicit cache ownership, cancellation, and a bounded rate/concurrency policy separate from CPU/file task concurrency.
6. Output tasks claim normalized destination paths/namespaces; overlap checks happen before scheduling.
7. Package/global template/browser/plugin caches must be proven read-only or made task-safe before post-level concurrency.
8. Build Lab differential/incremental/determinism checks and race tests remain mandatory gates for each fan-out slice.

## Next implementation sequence

1. Land deterministic resource claims (#1452).
2. Add compiled graph/resource diagnostics (#1454) so ownership is inspectable.
3. Introduce a serial item-task adapter and use `reading_time` as the smallest per-post proof.
4. Move `render_markdown` to serial per-post tasks and verify Build Lab equivalence.
5. Add immutable publish planning, then split `publish_html` and `publish_feeds` into serial per-output tasks.
6. Only after the graph and diagnostics prove disjoint ownership should any task become `ParallelSafe=true` or the executor accept `MaxParallel > 1`.
