# Multi-Author Collaboration

This post was written by multiple authors, each with a clearly defined role.

## How Multi-Author Works

In markata-go, you can specify multiple authors in the frontmatter using the
`authors` field. Each author ID maps to an author defined in your site configuration.

```yaml
authors:
  - waylon
  - guest
```

Both authors and their roles are displayed in the post header, making it easy for
readers to see who contributed and in what capacity.
