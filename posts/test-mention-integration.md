# Testing @mentions Integration

This post tests the new @mentions functionality with build-time metadata fetching.

I was reading @daverupert's latest post about CSS and found it really helpful. 

Also @simonwillison.net had some interesting thoughts on the future of AI.

Let's test @webmention.io to see how webmention services work.

The mentions should now have metadata baked into the HTML as data attributes, making hover cards instant without CORS issues.
