# Example resource hints configuration for waylonwalker.com

# Add this to your markata.toml file:

[resource_hints]
# Enable resource hints generation
enabled = true

# Auto-detect external domains from page content
auto_detect = true

# Exclude domains that appear in blogroll/reader pages
# These links are typically not visited from the current page
exclude_domains = [
    # Reader domain - has many external links to followed blogs
    "reader.waylonwalker.com",

    # Common social media domains that appear in many posts but aren't critical
    # Uncomment if you want to exclude them:
    # "twitter.com",
    # "github.com",
    # "youtube.com",
]

# Manually configure critical domains with specific hint types
# Only add domains that appear on many pages and are critical for performance

# Example: CDNs that are used across the site
# [[resource_hints.domains]]
# domain = "cdn.jsdelivr.net"
# hint_types = ["dns-prefetch"]

# [[resource_hints.domains]]
# domain = "cdn.tailwindcss.com"
# hint_types = ["dns-prefetch"]

# Example: Google Fonts (if you use them)
# [[resource_hints.domains]]
# domain = "fonts.googleapis.com"
# hint_types = ["preconnect"]

# [[resource_hints.domains]]
# domain = "fonts.gstatic.com"
# hint_types = ["preconnect"]
# crossorigin = "anonymous"
