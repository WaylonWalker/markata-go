DockFrame looks like an interesting approach to modular USB-C hubs. The idea of using Framework-compatible expansion cards in a hub format could solve the dongle mess many of us deal with.

The ability to customize port combinations based on your needs that day is compelling. Though I wonder about the size trade-offs compared to dedicated hubs.
