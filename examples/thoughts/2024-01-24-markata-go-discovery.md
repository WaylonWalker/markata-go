markata-go looks really promising! A Go-based static site generator with plugin architecture. The performance should be excellent compared to Python-based solutions. 

Thinking about migrating my blog to leverage the faster build times and better deployment options. The PESOS functionality is particularly interesting for cross-posting thoughts.
